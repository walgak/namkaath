git add Procfile
git commit -m "Fix Procfile to explicitly include :application for Gunicorn"
git push origin main

Render should automatically detect the new push and attempt a redeploy.

***

### **Option 2: Fix the Render Dashboard Setting (If Option 1 fails)**

If Render ignores the `Procfile` for some reason, you can manually fix the command directly in the Render dashboard:

1.  Go to your **namkaath** Web Service dashboard on Render.
2.  Go to the **Settings** tab.
3.  Scroll down to the **Start Command** field.
4.  Replace whatever is there with the correct command:
        gunicorn namkaath.wsgi:application
    5.  Click **Save Changes**.

This should trigger a new deployment which will now start successfully! Let me know if the site is up after the redeploy.
